# Light and Dark Mode

Because the browser supports and detects dark mode from user device's preferences, you can enable dark mode by default (through system/browser options) for better viewing in darker environment (and saves your battery if your display uses OLED display).

Enabling or toggling dark and light mode is very simple! Just click **'Day/Night'** on your desktop device or **moon/sun** (ðŸŒ™/ðŸŒž) icon on your mobile device

If your browser doesn't supports dark mode detection or your device doesn't use dark mode, you can toggle dark mode anytime from this site by click 'Day/Night' on your desktop device or 'moon'/'sun' icon on your mobile device.

Your light/dark mode option will stored to Local Storage for next visits.
